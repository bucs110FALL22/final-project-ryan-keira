## Project Description

<< Give an overview of your project >>

***    

## User Interface Design

- **Initial Concept**
  - << A wireframe or drawing of the user interface concept along with a short description of the interface. You should have one for each screen in your program. For example, if your program has a start screen, game screen, and game over screen, you should include a wireframe / screenshot / drawing of each one and a short description of the components. >>
    
    
- **Final GUI**
  - << You should also have a screenshot of each screen for your final GUI >>

***        

## Program Design

* Non-Standard libraries
    * << You should have a list of any additional libraries or modules used (pygame, request) beyond non-standard python. 
         For each additional module you should include
         - url for the module documentation
         - a short description of the module >>
* Class Interface Design
    * << A simple drawing that shows the class relationships in your code (see below for an example). This does not need to be overly detailed, but should show how your code fits into the Model/View/Controller paradigm. >>
        * ![class diagram](assets/class_diagram.jpg) 

* Non-Standard libraries
-Import pygame: Imports all available pygame modules
-Import time: Allows the use of a time limit.

* Classes
1.Puck: Puck will move up, down, left, and right.
2.Goal: Goal will move left and right.
3.Table: Table will be an image on which the puck will move on.
4.Timer: Will set time limit to 3 minutes
5.Player 1: Will choose to be either the red or blue team. Will be able to use arrows to hit the puck either righ, left, up, or down.
6.Player 2: Will choose to be either the red or blue team. Will be able to use arrows to hit the puck either righ, left, up, or down.

  
## Project Structure and File List

The Project is broken down into the following file structure:

* main.py
* src
    * << all of your python files should go here >>
* assets
    * << all of your media, i.e. images, font files, etc, should go here) >>
* etc
    * << This is a catch all folder for things that are not part of your project, but you want to keep with your project >>

***

## Tasks and Responsibilities 

   * Outline the team member roles and who was responsible for each class/method, both individual and collaborative.

## Testing

* << Describe your testing strategy for your project. >>
